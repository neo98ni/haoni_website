Hi! Iâ€™m Hao Ni!

I was born and raised in China. I had my high school and college in the U.S.. I recently moved to London to study at LBS.

I once studied abroad in London, and it was one of the best times in my life. Therefore, I decided to come back and continue studying!

Besides studying, I am a huge basketball fan, and I love LeBron James.  I look forward to meeting you on the court!

I wish you had some fun with my website!
